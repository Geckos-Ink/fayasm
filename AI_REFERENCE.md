# AI Reference

This document is a fast-access knowledge base for AI agents working on fayasm. Update it alongside `README.md` whenever you modify code or documentation so the next agent inherits the latest context.

## Collaboration Rules

- After every code edit, refresh both `README.md` and `AI_REFERENCE.md` with any relevant behavioural, architectural, or tooling changes.
- Log fresh research or experiments under `studies/` and cross-reference them here to avoid repeating the same investigations.
- Prefer incremental changes: keep commits small, document breaking changes, and run the available tests before yielding control.

## Build & Test Checklist

- Configure and build with CMake (>= 3.10): `cmake .. -DFAYASM_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DFAYASM_BUILD_SHARED=ON -DFAYASM_BUILD_STATIC=ON`
- Invoke the provided helper: `./build.sh` (cleans `build/`, regenerates, runs tests).
- Run the harness: `build/bin/fayasm_test_main` or `ctest --output-on-failure` inside the build directory.
- Ensure new tests land alongside new features; runtime code lacks extensive coverage, so favour regression tests around control flow and stack behaviour.

## Core Code Map

- `src/fa_runtime.*` – execution entry points, allocator hooks, call-frame management, operand stack reset.
- `src/fa_job.*` – linked-list operand stack (`fa_JobStack`) and register window (`fa_JobDataFlow`).
- `src/fa_ops.*` – opcode descriptors plus the delegate table; unimplemented handlers are clearly marked for future work.
- `src/fa_wasm.*` – file-descriptor driven parser for module sections (types, functions, exports, memories).
- `src/fa_wasm_stream.*` – cursor helpers used in the tests to exercise streaming reads.
- `src/helpers/dynamic_list.h` – pointer vector used by ancillary tools.
- `test/` – CMake target `fayasm_test_main` with coverage for wasm stream navigation and parser branches.
- `build.sh` – one-shot rebuild + test script; keep options in sync with documented build flags.

### Gaps Worth Watching

- Many opcode handlers are placeholders; when fleshing them out, add targeted tests.
- Module loading currently depends on file descriptors; embedding scenarios may require in-memory alternatives.
- Memory and trap semantics are preliminary—plan for bounds checking and better error propagation.

## When Starting a New Task

- Skim outstanding TODOs in source files (search for `TODO` or `FIXME`).
- Validate whether relevant studies already cover the topic; if not, add a new entry both under `studies/` and above.
- Outline expected tests; if the suite lacks coverage, note the gap here so the next agent can prioritise it.
